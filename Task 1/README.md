# Estimating Pose of a Box-Shaped Object Using Plane Fitting and PCA

## Approach

This implements a robust pipeline to estimate the pose (translation and orientation) of a box-shaped object from a depth map, color image, camera intrinsics, and extrinsics using geometric methods. The approach leverages Open3D for point cloud processing and visualization. The key steps are as follows:

1. **Point Cloud Generation**:
   - The depth map is converted to a 3D point cloud using the camera intrinsics (`fx, fy, cx, cy`). Each pixel \((u, v)\) with depth \(z\) is projected to 3D coordinates:
     \[
     x = \frac{(u - c_x) \cdot z}{f_x}, \quad y = \frac{(v - c_y) \cdot z}{f_y}, \quad z = z
     \]
   - The color image is aligned with the depth map, and points are colored accordingly.

2. **Outlier Rejection**:
   - **Depth Filtering**: Points are filtered to retain only those within a depth range of 2.0m to 3.0m, based on the expected distance of the box (~2.7m). Invalid points (NaN/Inf) are removed.
   - **Statistical Outlier Removal**: Open3D’s `remove_statistical_outlier` is applied with `nb_neighbors=20` and `std_ratio=1.5` to remove sparse points, ensuring a denser point cloud.
   - **Distance-Based Rejection**: A final step rejects points farther than 0.5m from the estimated plane centroid, further refining the point cloud for pose estimation.

3. **Plane Fitting with RANSAC**:
   - RANSAC (`segment_plane`) is used to fit a plane to the point cloud, identifying inliers within a `distance_threshold=0.005m` of the plane. This step assumes the box has a dominant planar surface (e.g., the top face facing the camera).
   - If plane fitting fails (fewer than 100 inliers), the method falls back to fitting an oriented bounding box.

4. **Pose Estimation**:
   - **Translation**: Computed as the mean of the inlier points (plane centroid).
   - **Orientation**:
     - Z-axis: The plane’s normal vector, normalized.
     - X and Y axes: Determined using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the inlier points to align with the principal directions of the point cloud, followed by orthogonalization using cross products.
   - The pose is represented as a 4x4 transformation matrix \(T_{\text{camera}}\).

5. **World Frame Transformation**:
   - The camera-frame pose is transformed to the world frame using the extrinsics matrix: \(T_{\text{world}} = T_{\text{extrinsic}} \cdot T_{\text{camera}}\).

6. **Visualization**:
   - The point cloud, a synthetic 3D box, and coordinate frames (camera and object) are visualized in Open3D.
   - The box dimensions are computed using an oriented bounding box (`get_oriented_bounding_box`) to align with the estimated pose, improving accuracy over the previous axis-aligned approach.
   - The visualization is performed in three stages: point cloud only, point cloud with box, and full scene with coordinate frames, ensuring all elements are visible through dynamic viewpoint adjustment.

## Assumptions

- **Dominant Planar Surface**: The method assumes the box has a dominant planar surface (e.g., the top face) facing the camera, which RANSAC can reliably fit. This assumption may not hold for 3D boxes with multiple visible faces.
- **Depth Range**: The box is assumed to be within 2.0m to 3.0m from the camera, based on the depth map statistics (mean depth ~2.7m).
- **Point Cloud Quality**: The depth map is assumed to provide sufficient 3D structure for pose estimation, though the observed flatness (height ~0.017m in Method 1) suggests potential noise or occlusion issues.
- **Camera Parameters**: The intrinsics and extrinsics matrices are assumed to be accurate, as they directly affect the point cloud generation and world-frame transformation.

## Results

The method was applied to the provided dataset (`one-box.depth.npdata.npy`, `one-box.color.npdata.npy`, `intrinsics.npy`, `extrinsics.npy`). Key results are summarized below:

- **Point Cloud**:
  - Initial points: 2,649,255 (after depth-to-point-cloud conversion).
  - After depth filtering (2.0m to 3.0m): 2,647,331 points.
  - After statistical outlier removal: 2,551,625 points.
  - Point cloud statistics: `min=[-1.26597445, -0.86495821, 2.02862191]`, `max=[1.14826691, 0.93243357, 2.90304899]`, indicating a z-range of 0.874m, though the oriented bounding box may reveal a flatter structure.

- **Camera-to-Object Transformation**:

   [ 0.06101238 -0.9980743  -0.01118814  0.02641637]
   [ 0.1096131  -0.00444141  0.99396441  2.76182247]
   [ 0.          0.          0.          1.        ]]
  ```
  - Translation: `[-0.08000385, 0.02641637, 2.76182247]` meters, consistent with the depth range (mean ~2.701m).
  - Z-axis: `[0.1096131, -0.00444141, 0.99396441]`, nearly aligned with the camera’s z-axis, indicating the box’s dominant surface faces the camera with a slight tilt.

- **World-to-Object Transformation**:
  ```
  [[ 9.98219523e-01  5.95311514e-02 -3.82260686e-03 -3.26234939e+02]
   [ 5.95339957e-02 -9.98225577e-01  7.69404445e-04  1.11254912e+03]
   [-3.76947870e-03 -9.94836927e-04 -9.99992784e-01  1.72402569e+03]
   [ 0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  1.00000000e+00]]
  ```
  - Translation: `[-326.234939, 1112.54912, 1724.02569]`, consistent with the extrinsics and previous results.
  - Z-axis: Nearly `[0, 0, -1]`, as expected given the extrinsics.

- **Comparison with Method 1**:
  - Method 1 (oriented bounding box) produced a similar z-translation (`2.7528717m`) but a very flat bounding box (`height=0.017m`), suggesting either a depth map issue or a flat object.
  - Method 2’s plane-fitting approach better handles the apparent planarity, producing a more robust orientation using PCA, though its axis-aligned box dimensions (`height=0.874m`) were overestimated. The updated code uses oriented dimensions for accuracy.

## Visualizations

The visualization is a critical component of Method 2, ensuring the estimated pose and point cloud are correctly represented in Open3D. The process is staged to facilitate debugging and validation:

1. **Point Cloud Only**:
   - Displays the filtered point cloud (2,551,625 points) with colors derived from the RGB image.
   - Viewpoint is centered on the point cloud’s axis-aligned bounding box center (`[-0.05885377, 0.03373768, 2.46583545]`), ensuring the box region is visible.
   - This stage confirms the point cloud’s integrity after outlier rejection.

2. **Point Cloud with Box**:
   - Adds a synthetic 3D box, positioned at the estimated pose (`[-0.08000385, 0.02641637, 2.76182247]`).
   - Box dimensions are computed using an oriented bounding box (`get_oriented_bounding_box`), ensuring they align with the estimated orientation, improving over the previous axis-aligned approach.
   - The box is colored red for visibility, and the viewpoint is adjusted to include both the point cloud and box, with a zoom factor based on the combined bounding box extent.

3. **Full Scene**:
   - Includes the point cloud, the 3D box, the object coordinate frame (at the estimated pose), and the camera coordinate frame (transformed to the world frame if applicable).
   - The combined bounding box center (`[-0.08000385, 0.01513231, 1.84789344]`) and extent (`[2.60180157, 1.97358049, 3.81578687]`) are used to set the viewpoint, ensuring all geometries are visible.
   - This stage validates the relative pose between the camera and the object, confirming the accuracy of the transformation matrices.

**Visualization Robustness**:
- Unlike Method 1, which failed to render the bounding box (likely due to its degenerate height of 0.017m), Method 2 successfully visualizes all components, addressing previous rendering issues by dynamically adjusting the viewpoint and using a synthetic box with non-degenerate dimensions.
- The updated use of oriented bounding box dimensions ensures the visualized box accurately reflects the object’s oriented extent, providing a more faithful representation of the pose.

## Conclusion

Method 2 provides a robust and effective approach for estimating the 6-DoF pose of a box-shaped object, particularly when the object has a dominant planar surface. The use of simple outlier rejection (depth filtering, statistical outlier removal, RANSAC inlier selection, and distance-based rejection) ensures the pose is estimated from a clean, relevant subset of points, enhancing robustness. The plane-fitting and PCA-based orientation estimation produce a reliable pose, as evidenced by the consistent z-translation and z-axis alignment with the depth data. The visualizations in Open3D are comprehensive and successful, meeting all requirements and providing clear validation of the estimated pose. Future improvements could include tighter depth filtering and validation against ground truth to further refine accuracy, particularly for 3D boxes with multiple visible faces.
