# Model Training Setup Report

## 1. Model Architecture
- **Backbone**: YOLOv11-S (Small Variant)
- **Task**: Instance Segmentation
- **Architecture Highlights**:
  - Lightweight yet deep feature extraction backbone.
  - Decoupled detection head for classification and bounding box regression.
  - Segmentation branch integrated with spatial attention modules.
  - Optimized for both speed and accuracy trade-offs.

---

## 2. Loss Functions
- **Overall Loss** = `Box Regression Loss` + `Segmentation Loss` + `Classification Loss` + `Distribution Focal Loss (DFL)`
  - **Box Regression**: Generalized Intersection over Union (GIoU) Loss.
  - **Segmentation**: Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) + Dice Loss (for mask quality).
  - **Classification**: Binary Cross Entropy (BCE) Loss.
  - **Distribution Focal Loss (DFL)**: Used for precise bounding box localization refinement.

## 3. Training Hyperparameters
- **Initial Learning Rate**: `0.01`
- **Optimizer**: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) with momentum.
- **Learning Rate Scheduler**: Cosine Annealing with Warm Restarts.
- **Momentum**: `0.937`
- **Weight Decay**: `5e-4`
- **Batch Size**: (Assumed standard for YOLOv11-S) ~ `16â€“64` depending on hardware.

---

## 4. Data Augmentation
- **Geometric Augmentations**:
  - Random scaling.
  - Random translation.
  - Random horizontal flipping (probability = 0.5).
  - Mosaic augmentation (combining 4 images into one).
  - MixUp augmentation (image blending).
- **Photometric Augmentations**:
  - Random brightness and contrast shifts.
  - Color space augmentations (HSV adjustments).

**Purpose**:  
To increase model robustness and generalization across diverse object scales, orientations, and lighting conditions.

---

## 5. Training Schedule
- **Maximum Epochs**: `100`
- **Early Stopping**:
  - Patience of `15` epochs without improvement on validation metrics.
- **Checkpointing**:
  - Best model selection based on validation mAP (mean Average Precision).
  - Saving latest model every few epochs for backup.
